<h2>Predictable "random" password</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p>
<p>Let's say we are trying to establish encrypted communication with our friend. For this, we will use a secret seed that we agreed on, then generate a 10-character long password and prompt our friend for the same password. If it is indeed our friend, the words will match.</p>
<p>Write a function that takes a known seed and generates a string of exactly 10 random printable characters (codes between 33 and 126 inclusive) using this seed. Use the <code class="java">.toChar()</code>  function to convert a random number to a character and join all the characters into a single string.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Make sure to call the Random constructor only once and reuse the same instance to generate all the numbers.</p>
<p><b>Tip:</b> Note that code 33 and 126 both need to be included.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
